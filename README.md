Visualize Weather Data

## Background

The climate has been so abnormal in the most recent years. I build this tool so that people can view precipitation pattern in any location by demand. 

Here is a link to the [app](https://awherelabs.shinyapps.io/weather-visual)

## Weather in Denver - Current and 10 Year Norm

I live in University of Denver area right next to a sister city park called Kunming Park (my hometown). Lets see how the precipitation has been like.

The graph gives you an overview of weather pattern has been like from 2008-01-01 to today with 6 days forecast. I color coded current precipitation as blue and the 10 years long term normal as grey. 

Obviously, when looking at the long term normal, there are a lot of pattern seasonality one can visually identify. Rainy season seems to be at April to Jun and August always get some really wet days with average rainfall at about 70 mm. 

Interestingly, since 2013, there has been so much rain at this park. Highest was in September 2014 with 182.82 accumulative rainfall in one month. 


## Weather in Denver - Current and 3 Year Norm

When looking at current precipitation compare to 3 years norm, the weather pattern is even more interesting.

In this graph, what you see is accumulative rainfall for current year compare to 3 years norm. When looking at shorter term, the normal rainfall pattern looks less uniformed.
